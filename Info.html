    <h1 style="text-align:center";>Info On Jumbo The Elephant</h1>
    <p style="text-align:center; font-size:150%";>Jumbo was an elephant captured in Africa in the year 1862. He was moved to many places, one of those places was Paris. Jumbo was the star of P.T. Barnum's "Greatest Show on Earth" where it is said, he brought in the largest crowds in the history of the circus. His last destination was St. Thomas, Ontario. Two railway tracks ran close to the grounds where the circus tents were pitched. The circus received permission to take down some fencing so that they could move the animals along quickly after shows. While Jumbo and another smaller elephant were being escoted across the tracks, the handler noticed a train appear. The smaller elephant was struck from behind and tossed into a ditch breaking its legs, while Jumbo was hit in the back of the legs, this brought him to his knees. Jumbo being such a large animal, the force caused the train to derail. Jumbo was severely injured. He laid on the track and reached out for his handler, who comforted him while he slowly died, at only the age of 24. Jumbo was a huge guy, he was a very popular circus elephant, in fact he was one of the main reasons why people travelled to St. Thomas. Jumbo's bones were preserved and his intact skeleton lives at the American Mueseum of Natural History in New York City.

After Jumbo passed, there was a statue made in his memory. People went out of their way to see him, and it had turned St. Thomas into a new tourist location.There was a lot of controversy surrounding the sale of Jumbo and the treatment in the circus raised awareness about animal rights and the need for better care towards animals.
